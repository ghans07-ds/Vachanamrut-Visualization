# Vachanamrut-Visualization

The main objective of this Project was to get some insight from the text-data.
The text-data is about the holy hindu scripture “Vachnamrut”. Which is in the
Gujarati language. We found many patterns from the data after visualizing it.
We had used some NLP-techniques to process this data.
